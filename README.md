# Scorca Data
This repository contains data collected during multiple tests of the Scorca agent.

This data was used to generate the various graphs seen in the ICAART paper and to forge decisions for the agent,
i.e. with which strategy to go and which hyperparameters to use.

It also contains multiple scripts used to generate the graphs.

For the agent logic, please refer to the [Scorca repository](https://github.com/Robinbux/Scorca).
